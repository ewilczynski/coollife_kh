Due to the change of legal basis, a break in series occurs between 2020 and 2021. Readers are encouraged to analyse the differences between both Directives (RED I and RED II), the energy sector and all national specificities before drawing any conclusions from the comparison of year 2021 with previous time series. The SHARES Manual provides details on the methodology used for the calculation of the share of renewables.

Hydro is normalised (averaged over a number of years to smooth out the effects of climatic variation) and excluding pumping. Wind is also normalised (and from 2021 onwards as per RED II separately for on-shore and off-shore). Solar includes solar photovoltaics and solar thermal power generation. All other renewables include electricity generation from gaseous and liquid biofuels, renewable municipal waste, geothermal, and tide, wave & ocean. Only electricity produced from compliant liquid biofuels can be accounted. For 2021 onwards (as per RED II), also solid and gaseous biofuels combusted in installations above a certain threshold need to comply with sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria. Renewable energy sources used for heating and cooling include solar thermal, geothermal energy, ambient heat captured by heat pumps for heating (and from 2021 onwards, renewable cooling, as per RED II), solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels, and the renewable part of waste. Only heat produced from compliant liquid biofuels can be accounted for. From 2021 onwards (as per RED II), solid and gaseous biofuels combusted in installations above a certain threshold need to comply with sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria.

It is used for three appliance systems where sufficient data is available: split residential air conditioners, car air conditioners and domestic refrigerators. The second method is a simpler modelling approach based on ratios of RAC systems per inhabitants. This approach was used to determine the existing stock of ten additional appliance systems: self-contained air conditioners, commercial ducted splits, multi-splits, air conditioning chillers, mobile air conditioning in buses, stand-alone equipment (commercial refrigeration), condensing units (commercial refrigeration), centralised units in supermarkets, centralised industrial systems, and refrigerated transport. This calculated stock is then used to derive current and future unit sales figures and finally, to calculate the emissions and the potential to reduce emissions. The data shown here represents the best possible estimation based on the available data. Numbers from the two calculation approaches were combined and some individual appliance systems (such as rooftop ducted air conditioners, integral and condensing units in industrial refrigeration) could not be covered by either method due to a lack of accurate data. The figures may not fully reflect the actual situation in some countries. However, the results do give a general overview of emissions in the RAC subsectors.
